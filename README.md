Code and data to replicate the experiments presented in the paper "Conditions for Unnecessary Logical Constraints in Kernel Machines"

# Examples

The two files data2.mat and data3.mat contain the datapoints where the learnable functions are evaluated and calckernel.m allows to calculate the Gram matrix of a linear, polynomial or gaussian kernel.

Run the scripts ex2.m and ex3.m to get the optimal solutions of Example 2 and Example 3 in the paper, respectively.

Run the script print.m to visualize the optimal functions you got which best fit the constraints.

Instructions and useful comments are reported on the top of such scripts.
