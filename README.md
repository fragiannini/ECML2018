Code and data to replicate the experiments presented in the paper "Conditions for Unnecessary Logical Constraints in Kernel Machines"

# Examples

The two files data2.mat and data3.mat contain the datapoints where the learnable functions are evaluated and calckernel.m allows to calculate the Gram matrix of a linear, polynomial or gaussian kernel.

Run the scripts ex2.m and ex3.m to get the optimal solutions of Example 2 and Example 3 in the paper, respectively.

Instructions and useful comments are reported on the top of such scripts.
